## Photomath
Often, we need to solve large mathematical equations fast and with less effort. Simple Photomath has been built from that need. All that is required is an image of the math that one is required to solve. Simple Photomath is a program that can solve or simplify a number of mathematical equations and
problems, which are extracted from its image. Thereafter one will get as output, the solution of that math. Photomath can perform 4 functions:

1. Solve polynomial equations (Up to any degree)

2. Solve system of linear equations (Up to any number of variables)

3. Simplify Mathematical expressions

4. Derive the polynomial equation of a graph from its image.
